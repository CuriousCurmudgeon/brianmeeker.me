## From Punch Cards to Git: A Brief History of Version Control

_Believe it or not, there was a time before Git. Even longer ago, there was a time before version control. In this conference session, we will discuss version control systems of yesteryear, such as SCSS and RCS, file locking, versioning, the Darcs patch theory, the history of version control, different paradigms, and the future of version control._

## It's a Live(View): Discover the Elixir of Life With a Virtual Pet

_Are you tired of writing JavaScript? Are you only using Node to avoid context shifting between languages? Good news! In recent years there has been an explosion in developer options for creating rich, real-time browser-based apps with little to no JavaScript!_

_This session will give a brief overview of Elixir and then create a virtual pet app using Phoenix LiveView. You'll leave the session knowing the pros and cons of this model vs. traditional JavaScript frameworks and a virtual pet who will provide you with unconditional love until you forget to feed it for too long._
