## From Punch Cards to Git: A Brief History of Version Control

_Believe it or not, there was a time before Git. Even longer ago, there was a time before version control. In this conference session, we will discuss version control systems of yesteryear, such as SCSS and RCS, file locking, versioning, the Darcs patch theory, the history of version control, different paradigms, and the future of version control._

## Taming Personal Knowledge Management with Obsidian and Dataview

_Obsidian allows you to take notes entirely in Markdown. Dataview lets you query metadata in those notes. Come learn how you can use them to track your life for fun and (no) profit!_

## It's a Live(View): Discover the Elixir of Life With a Virtual Pet

_Are you tired of writing JavaScript? Are you only using Node to avoid context shifting between languages? Good news! In recent years there has been an explosion in developer options for creating rich, real-time browser-based apps with little to no JavaScript!_

_This session will give a brief overview of Elixir and then create a virtual pet app using Phoenix LiveView. You'll leave the session knowing the pros and cons of this model vs. traditional JavaScript frameworks and a virtual pet who will provide you with unconditional love until you forget to feed it for too long._

## Messaging With Limits: Concurrent, Multi-Stage Data Processing in the Real World

_Our team at GetThru found ourselves with a scaling problem. Working with our existing infrastructure for sending text messages was becoming increasingly complex. Years of bewildering external requirements had led us to the point where the existing system was both incorrect and difficult to reason about._

_In this session, we'll go over a case study of our new concurrent, multi-stage data processing pipeline. Starting from the fundamentals, we'll see how our team efficiently handled our existing external requirements and built in flexibility for the future. Finally, we'll look at how we did all of this in our existing monolith, avoiding the complexity of microservices._

## SPAs Without Javascript: Simplify Your Stack

_Are you tired of writing JavaScript? Are you only using Node to avoid context shifting between languages? Good news! In recent years there has been an explosion in developer options for creating rich, real-time, browser-based apps with little-to-no JavaScript!_

_This session will give a brief overview of these options and dive deep into an app built with one of them. You'll leave the session knowing the pros and cons of this new model vs. traditional JavaScript frameworks and a virtual pet who will provide you with unconditional love until you forget to feed it for too long._
