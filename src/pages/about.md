<h1 class="text-center">About</h1>

I’ve been a professional software engineer since 2007 in a wide variety of languages and frameworks. I got a headstart on the remote world by working 100% remote since 2012. I probably don’t even remember how to work in an office.

I’ve worked professionally with a wide variety of languages and frameworks. 

When not writing code, I’m playing with my two daughters, listening to metal, and playing Magic: The Gathering. On a good day I get to do all of these things at once.
